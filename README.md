This section is the code part developed for *2019Spring CSCE-611 Opertaing system Course*.

The Development Exection Environment: Ubuntu Linux under VirtualBox.\
Source Revision Control environment: Github.\
Emulation Environment: Bochs with GDB Integration.

Assignments includes:

In steup folder: set up the environment for the simple kernel, including bochs, GDB installment.

In Frame_manager folder: Get started on a demand-paging based virtual memory system for our kernel. Implement a frame manager which manage a collection of frame pools.

In Page_table folder: Continue on the demand-paging baed virtual memory system. Studied the paging mechanism on the X86 architecture and initialied the paging system and the page table infrastructure.

In Allocator folder: Extend our virtual memory system to support large numbers and sizes address space. Develop a simple virtual memory allocator.

In Scheduling folder: Add scheduling of multiple kernel-level threads to my code base.

In Drivers folder: Investigate kernel-level device drivers on top of a simple programmed-I/O block device. add a layer on top of this device to support same blocking read and write opertaions as the basic implementation.

In File_system folder: Implement a simple file system which allows sequential access only.
